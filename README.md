## Features

An external API (in this case, a Firebase Realtime Database) is used and the Redux store is updated accordingly.

Thunk Middleware is used Thunk middleware allows the usage of asynchronous logic in Redux actions. Thunks are functions that can be dispatched like regular actions and can perform async operations before dispatching actual actions.

Error Handling  is provided. The code handles potential errors gracefully by using try/catch blocks to catch errors that occur during async operations and dispatching appropriate actions to update the UI with error messages.
